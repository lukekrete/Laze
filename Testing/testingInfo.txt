The plan for testing at the moment is to do user testing first.
This will include setting up the local host (see the readme if you don't know how to setup) and searching/recording bugs, errors, potential improvements, etc.
Then more sophisticated testing via methods, use of django resources, or other code.  

Ideally this will be brought up on Wednesday Dec 5 to see how this will pan out.
Regardless, progress on testing will start the following day of the meeting to create a -somewhat- refined testing log.
